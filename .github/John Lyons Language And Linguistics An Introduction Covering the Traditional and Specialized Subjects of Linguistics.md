## What is Linguistics?
 
Linguistics is the scientific study of human language[^3^]. It is a multidisciplinary field that covers various aspects of language, such as its sounds, meanings, grammar, usage, history, evolution, and diversity. Linguists aim to describe, explain, and understand how language works, how it is acquired, how it changes, how it interacts with other cognitive and social systems, and how it reflects and shapes human thought and culture.
