Swami Chinmayananda, a renowned spiritual teacher and founder of Chinmaya Mission, gave a series of talks on Vivekachudamani in 1972. These talks were recorded and transcribed into a book, which is available as a PDF download from the Internet Archive[^1^].
  
In his talks, Swami Chinmayananda explains the profound concepts of Vivekachudamani in a simple and practical way. He guides the seeker through the stages of discrimination, detachment, renunciation, meditation, and realization. He also illustrates the teachings with stories, anecdotes, and examples from daily life.
  
Vivekachudamani by Swami Chinmayananda is a valuable resource for anyone who wants to understand the essence of Vedanta and experience the bliss of self-knowledge. It is a book that can transform one's life and lead to the ultimate goal of human existence.
  
The Vivekachudamani consists of 581 verses in the form of a dialogue between a teacher and a student. The teacher is traditionally identified as Shankara himself, while the student is said to be one of his four disciples, either Padmapada, Sureshvara, Hastamalaka, or Totaka.
  
The main theme of the text is the exposition of the doctrine of Advaita Vedanta, or non-dualism. According to this doctrine, there is only one reality, which is Brahman, the absolute and supreme self. Everything else, including the individual self (jiva) and the world (jagat), is an illusion (maya) caused by ignorance (avidya).
  
The text begins with a salutation to Govinda, who is identified as both Vishnu and Shankara's guru. The student then approaches the teacher with humility and reverence, and expresses his desire to attain liberation (moksha) from the cycle of birth and death (samsara). He asks the teacher to instruct him on the means to achieve this goal.
  
The teacher praises the student for his earnestness and qualifications, and tells him that the only means to liberation is the knowledge of one's true nature as Brahman. He then proceeds to explain the nature of Brahman, the nature of ignorance, the nature of bondage and liberation, the qualifications of a seeker, the methods of inquiry and meditation, the obstacles and pitfalls on the path, and the signs and fruits of realization.
  
The Vivekachudamani teaches that the ultimate goal of human life is to realize one's identity with Brahman, the supreme self, which is the source of all existence, consciousness, and bliss. This realization is not a mere intellectual understanding, but a direct and immediate experience that transcends the limitations of the mind and senses.

To attain this realization, one has to cultivate four qualifications: discrimination (viveka) between the eternal and the ephemeral, dispassion (vairagya) towards the pleasures and pains of the world, six virtues (shat-sampat) such as control of the mind and senses, and intense longing for liberation (mumukshutva). These qualifications prepare the mind for receiving the knowledge of Brahman.
  
The knowledge of Brahman is imparted by a competent teacher (guru), who is well-versed in the scriptures (shastra) and established in his own experience (anubhava). The teacher instructs the student through a method of analysis (anvaya-vyatireka) that shows the identity of the individual self (atman) and the supreme self (Brahman). The student has to listen to the teacher's words with faith (shraddha), reflect on them with reason (yukti), and meditate on them with concentration (nididhyasana).
