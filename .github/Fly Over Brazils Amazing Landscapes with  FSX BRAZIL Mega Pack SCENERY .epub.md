## Iguazu Falls
 
One of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world, Iguazu Falls is a must-see for anyone visiting Brazil. Located on the border between Brazil and Argentina, the falls consist of 275 individual cascades that span nearly 3 km (1.9 mi) in width and plunge up to 82 m (269 ft) in height. The best way to appreciate the falls is to take a boat ride under them or walk along the trails and bridges that offer panoramic views. You can also visit the nearby Iguazu National Park, which protects a vast area of subtropical rainforest and its rich biodiversity.
 
## The Amazon
 
The Amazon rainforest is the largest and most diverse tropical forest on Earth, covering about 40% of Brazil's territory. It is home to millions of plant and animal species, many of which are endemic and endangered. The Amazon also plays a vital role in regulating the global climate and providing oxygen and freshwater. Exploring the Amazon is an unforgettable experience that can be done in various ways, such as staying in a jungle lodge, cruising along the Amazon River, hiking through the forest, or visiting indigenous communities.
 
## The Pantanal
 
If you love wildlife, you won't want to miss the Pantanal, the world's largest wetland that sprawls over parts of Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay. The Pantanal boasts an incredible concentration and diversity of animals, including jaguars, caimans, capybaras, anacondas, macaws, toucans and more. The best time to visit is during the dry season from May to September when the water levels are lower and the animals are easier to spot. You can join guided tours that will take you on safaris by boat, jeep or horseback.
